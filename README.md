My Trade bot @ [cex.io](https://cex.io/)
=====================

Using a stupid algorithm to follow up trade price of GHS/BTC and put orders automaticly.


The python API library is from [here](https://github.com/matveyco/cex.io-api-python.git).

But the API lib doesn't handle HTTP request errors :(

    api_key = ''
